# restful-JSON-assignment
Assignment serves as a headless, RESTful back end application, serving JSON middleware, to power a Single Page Application (SPA) built by a front end Engineer.
- Designed Model-View-Control architecture.
- Reverse engineered the Ajax requests the SPA makes to the back end service. Configured the Routes in Zend Framework 3 to match the Ajax requests.
- Implemented search function to search for picture title in the database, and return the proper JSON format to send to view layer.
